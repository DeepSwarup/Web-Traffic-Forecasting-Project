# Web Traffic Forecasting Project

## Overview
Web traffic forecasting is crucial for optimizing server resources, enhancing user experience, and planning marketing strategies. This project utilizes time series analysis techniques, specifically focusing on the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, to predict future web traffic patterns based on historical data.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The project loads historical web traffic data from a CSV file, cleans the data by handling missing values and formatting dates, and prepares it for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Through visualizations and statistical tests (e.g., Augmented Dickey-Fuller), the project explores trends, seasonality, and stationarity in the web traffic data.
- **ARIMA Modeling:** It applies the ARIMA model to capture the temporal dependencies and fluctuations in web traffic, making predictions that can aid in resource allocation and capacity planning.
- **Visualization:** The project includes visual representations of actual vs. forecasted web traffic data to assess the model's accuracy and provide insights for decision-making.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (3.6+)
- Required Python packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-traffic-forecasting.git
   cd web-traffic-forecasting
